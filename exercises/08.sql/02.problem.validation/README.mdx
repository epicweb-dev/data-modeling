# Validation

👨‍💼 When you execute a raw query like this, it's not possible to determine the
actual types for what the database gives back to you. Because we're querying our
own database, we can pretty well trust the data that will come back. So we could
just do this:

```tsx
type Report = {
	id: string
	name: string
	number: number
}
type Reports = Array<Report>

const reports = (await prisma.$queryRaw`
SELECT id, name, number
FROM ...
`) as Reports
```

But the issue here is we could easily (or accidentally) change our `SELECT`
statement or change our database schema and there wouldn't be anything to stop
us from shipping that breakage to production (except for maybe the tests you for
sure have 😉).

So what we can do instead, is add runtime validation with
[zod](https://zod.dev):

```tsx
import {z} from 'zod'
const ReportSchema = z({
  id: z.string()
  name: z.string()
  number: z.number()
})
const ReportsSchema = z.array(ReportSchema)

const rawReports = await prisma.$queryRaw`
SELECT id, name, number
FROM ...
`
const result = ReportsSchema.safeParse(rawReports)
if (!result.success) {
  // handle the error case with result.error.message
}
const reports = result.data
```

So, let's add some runtime validation of our users query to protect ourselves
from ourselves when executing this raw query.

🦉 To test the error case, simply add or change a property in your zod schema or
in the SELECT statement of the query.
