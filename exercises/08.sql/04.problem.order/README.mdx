# Order By

üë®‚Äçüíº Ok ok, hear me out. It's awesome that we can search by our user's names and
usernames. But what would be more awesome is if the users were sorted by how
active they've been. We don't want to have a user who hasn't added or updated
a note in months or years coming up ahead of a user who adds and updates notes
on a daily basis.

We want our users to find the most active users. So let's sort things by how
active they've been. We'll do this by identifying each user's most recently
updated note. We'll use the `updatedAt` of the most recently updated note. And
then sort the users we've found by that field for each of them.

ü¶â `Order By` can be pretty straightforward:

```sql
SELECT id, title, content from Review ORDER BY updatedAt LIMIT 30;
```

But it can also be more complicated using a nested query, which is what we'll
need to do:

```sql
SELECT
	id,
	name,
	content
from
	Ship as ship
ORDER BY
	(
		SELECT
			avgRating
		FROM
			(
				SELECT
					ship.id,
					AVG(shipReview.rating) AS avgRating
				FROM
					Ship ship
					INNER JOIN ShipReview shipReview ON shipReview.subjectId = ship.id
				GROUP BY
					ship.id
			) AS shipRatings
		WHERE
			shipRatings.id = ship.id
	) DESC
LIMIT
	50
```

üë®‚Äçüíº Luckily, our `ORDER BY` won't be _quite_ as complicated. Nested queries like
this are one example of the power of SQL!

It's easiest to think of the nested query on its own before combining it with
the parent query. So consider the requirement:

1. Select `updatedAt`
1. From the `Note` model
1. Where the `ownerId` matches the `user.id`
1. Order by the `updatedAt` descending (`DESC`)
1. Get only the first one (`LIMIT`)

Once you have that, then you can wrap that in an `ORDER BY` and you're golden.

To test this one out, perform a search, then open the second user, and edit
one of their notes. Go back and perform the same search and that user should
show up on top.
