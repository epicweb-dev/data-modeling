👨‍💼 Great job! So far we're not doing anything you couldn't do with regular
Prisma, but we'll get there. I've got some more requirements for you than we
had before. Let's take care of the TypeScript issues first though...

If you want to, you can
update <InlineFile file="app/utils/db.server.ts" /> to remove the old in-memory
`db` we had before. We're not using anywhere else anymore!

If you'd rather not, 🧝‍♂️ Kellie will do it for you.
