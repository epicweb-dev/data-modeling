# Raw SQL

üë®‚Äçüíº Our user search is the last thing that needs to be updated to use SQLite
instead of the in-memory database. I've got some requirements in mind for this
feature, but for now, we're going to start small with something you could
definitely do with regular Prisma queries, and then add onto it for some
features you couldn't.

First off, I want you to select user's id, name, and username. I want the `searchTerm`
to match against the username or the name, and I only want the first 50 results.

You're going to need to use `LIKE` in your `WHERE` clause and `OR` as well.
Here's an example of what the SQL might look like if we were trying to search
for reviews that had the word "great" in them:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Review" WHERE "text" LIKE '%great%';
```

And here's an example of a query that uses `OR`:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Review" WHERE "text" LIKE '%great%' OR "text" LIKE '%awesome%';
```

The `%` sign is a wildcard that matches any number of characters. So, the first
query would match "great", "not great", "great great great", etc. That character
needs to be part of what you interpolate into the Prisma raw query, so if you
wanted to parameterize that second query it would look like this:

```tsx
const searchTerm1 = '%great%'
const searchTerm2 = '%awesome%'
await prisma.$queryRaw`
  SELECT * FROM "Review" WHERE "text" LIKE ${searchTerm1} OR "text" LIKE ${searchTerm2};
`
```

In our case, you'll be getting the search term from the query string and it
could be `null`, so you'll want to fallback to `''` if it is. Also, you'll be
using the same search term for both the username and name fields.
