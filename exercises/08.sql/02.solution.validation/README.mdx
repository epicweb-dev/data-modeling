# Validation

👨‍💼 Looking good! Now we can more safely change our database schema and the
query! You will want to make sure to add a test to this page to help catch
mistakes, but we're much better off having this validation in place.

🦉 Parsing data at runtime can be a potential issue if there are many records
to parse and validate. However that's unlikely to be an issue here with a limit
of 50 records. That said, we could definitely strip this in production with
something like this:

```ts remove=1 add=2-8
const result = UserSearchResultsSchema.safeParse(rawUsers)
const result =
	ENV.MODE === 'production'
		? ({
				success: true,
				data: rawUsers as z.infer<typeof UserSearchResultsSchema>,
		  } as const)
		: UserSearchResultsSchema.safeParse(rawUsers)
if (!result.success) {
	return json({ status: 'error', error: result.error.message } as const, {
		status: 400,
	})
}
return json({ status: 'idle', users: result.data } as const)
```

And we can turn that into a util function as well if we found ourselves wanting
to do that a lot.
