# Order By

👨‍💼 Terrific work! You should be proud of yourself! Give yourself a pat on the
back! (I would, but I'm just a 👨‍💼 emoji).

🦉 I want to call out that until we added the `order by` we didn't need to use
`prisma.$queryRaw`. Prisma is pretty powerful by itself and most of the time you
don't need to reach for raw SQL statements. But when you do, you'll be glad that
you could.
