# Joins

👨‍💼 Currently our user search page is only showing the fallback image for our
users because our query is too simple and doesn't include the users' images.

The image data isn't stored in the user table, but in a UserImage table, so we need
to have the database join the two records together to form a single record which
it can return back to us.

🦉 Let's talk about database joins for a moment.

[![Visual representation of Inner, Left, Right, and Full Joins by The Data Geekery SQL Masterclass](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/1500684/255709471-45870c2d-477c-41fa-bdb0-ab90b456e5e1.png)](https://blog.jooq.org/say-no-to-venn-diagrams-when-explaining-joins/)

Considering this chart, think of the left side of the join as our User table and
the right side as the Image table. We want to get all the users whether or not
they have an image, but if they do have an image we want their image ID. Which
of these matches that desired result? It should result in all of the rows on the
left (but none extra), and the right rows where available.

So what we want to add here is a LEFT JOIN.

When you perform a join, you define the table you want to join to, and then you
define the condition for the join. In our case, we want to join the `Images` to
the `Users` where the `user.id` matches the `image.userId`. This means that the
database will look at each row in the `Users` table, and then look at each row
in the `Images` table, and if the `userId` matches, it will include the `Image`
row in the result.

Here's an example of the syntax for a `LEFT JOIN` for joining space ships to
their models:

```sql
SELECT ships.id, ships.name, models.name AS modelName
FROM ships
LEFT JOIN models ON ships.modelId = models.id
```

Notice that with this, we have access to the `models` in our `SELECT` statement.

👨‍💼 Great, so let's add a left join to our query so we can access the user's
image's `id` so we can include the `image.id` in our select so we can display it
in our app.

You'll also want to update the zod schema to account for the new field.
