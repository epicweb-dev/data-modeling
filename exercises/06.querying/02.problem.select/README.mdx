# Select

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/data-modeling-deep-dive/querying-data/transitioning-to-real-database-with-prisma-api" />

Let's talk about this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = 1;
```

Maybe we really _do_ want all the user's data, but most of the time we don't
really need to retrieve the user's `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields. We
certainly wouldn't want to get their `password` (which of course would _not_ be
a part of the `User` model and certainly wouldn't be stored in plaintext, but
this is the wrong workshop to get involved in that discussion).

So instead, you normally want to be more selective about what you're retrieving:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email FROM user WHERE id = 1;
```

The same thing applies with Prisma. By default, if you don't have a `select`,
Prisma will return all the fields on the model. But you can be more selective
about what you want to retrieve:

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
	select: { id: true, name: true, email: true },
	where: { id: 1 },
})
```

Let's migrate our Profile page to use our prisma client and select only the
fields we need for our UI.

`select` is also applicable for `create` and `update` operations as well. If you
don't care about the return value of an operation, then I recommend you
specify a select that only returns the `id` field. This will reduce the amount
of data that needs to be returned from the database and will improve performance
of your application.

So once you're finished with the Profile page, go back to the seed script and
add a select to the two `create` calls there.
