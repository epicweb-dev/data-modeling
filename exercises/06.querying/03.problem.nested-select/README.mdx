# Nested Select

👨‍💼 On our `/users/:username/notes` page, we're currently doing two queries to
our in-memory database:

1. Get the owner
2. Get the notes

We can definitely do this with Prisma, but it's even more efficient to do a
single query that gets the owner and the notes in one go.

This is something you can do with Prisma's `select` option. Here's an example
of what a nested select would look like if we wanted to get all the reviews for
a space ship:

```ts
await prisma.ship.findUnique({
	where: { id },
	select: {
		id: true,
		name: true,
		reviews: {
			select: { id: true, body: true, rating: true },
		},
	},
})
```

<details>

<summary>This will give us data that looks something like this:</summary>

```json
{
	"id": 1,
	"name": "Millennium Falcon",
	"reviews": [
		{
			"id": 1,
			"body": "She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid",
			"rating": 4
		},
		{
			"id": 2,
			"body": "What a piece of junk!",
			"rating": 1
		},
		{
			"id": 3,
			"body": "She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy!",
			"rating": 4
		},
		{
			"id": 4,
			"body": "You came in that thing? You're braver than I thought.",
			"rating": 2
		},
		{
			"id": 5,
			"body": "It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs.",
			"rating": 5
		}
	]
}
```

</details>

Can you please update the notes route so we get our data from SQLite and only do
a single query to get the owner and the notes?

Oh, and you'll need to make a couple changes in other spots because the notes
will now be a property of the owner instead of a sibling on the loader data.

<callout-warning>
	Prisma also has an `include` option which makes it easier to include related
	models. NEVER USE THIS. It's just there for convenience for selecting all
	fields for a record, but you never want to do that anyway.
