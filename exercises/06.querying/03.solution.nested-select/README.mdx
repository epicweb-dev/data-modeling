# Nested Select

👨‍💼 That's enough for now. Migrating the rest of our `select`s will be more of
the same. 💯 As extra credit, you can update the `loader`
for <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId.tsx" />
and <InlineFile file="app/routes/users+/$username_+/notes.$noteId_.edit.tsx" />.
If you don't, 🧝‍♂️ Kellie will do it for you.

🧝‍♂️ I'm also going to change our not edit form schema a tiny bit on the server to
add a `transform` so we can change the `image.file` from a `File` object to an
object with `contentType: string, blob: Buffer` which will make it easier to
insert into the database. If you're feeling adventurous, try to do that on your
own. If not, I'll do it for you. Feel free to peak at the diff if you want to
see how I did it.

Now it's time that we start thinking about how to manage updates with prisma.
Let's get to that next!
