# Multi-Column Index

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/data-modeling-deep-dive/query-optimization/optimizing-user-search-query-performance-with-indexing" />

üë®‚Äçüíº As we've accumulated more and more users who have more and more notes, we've
found that our query for the user list is getting slower and slower and using
more and more memory and CPU. We need to optimize this query.

I need you to do some analysis on the query and determine what indexes we need
to add to optimize it.

üê® Before you go straight to make the **one line code change**
in <InlineFile file="prisma/schema.prisma" />, please read through these
instructions to do some analysis.

<callout-info>
	If you'd like to observe the performance issue, you can update the seed script
	to generate more users and more notes per user. This could make the seed
	script take a **very very** long time (several minutes). You should notice
	major slow downs by having 15000 users each with 200-300 notes. You can also
	comment out the images bit if you want it to run faster since images shouldn't
	affect this. If you do this, a query with no search term should take ~8
	seconds.
</callout-info>

## Identify the problem query

If you run the query by opening <LinkToApp to="/users" />, you should see the
query that was executed in the terminal output. It should log something like
this:

```sql
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name, image.id AS imageId
FROM User AS user
LEFT JOIN UserImage AS image ON user.id = image.userId
WHERE user.username LIKE ?
OR user.name LIKE ?
ORDER BY (
        SELECT updatedAt
        FROM Note
        WHERE ownerId = user.id
        ORDER BY updatedAt DESC
        LIMIT 1
) DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

If you seeded your database with lots of data, you should also notice it took
a _long_ time for your data to come back. Yikes!

## Analyze the problem query

The `?` in that query represent interpolated values. To use this in the sqlite
`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` command, we need to replace those with values. So, let's
run this query with some values:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name, image.id AS imageId
FROM User AS user
LEFT JOIN UserImage AS image ON user.id = image.userId
WHERE user.username LIKE "%kody%"
OR user.name LIKE "%kody%"
ORDER BY (
        SELECT updatedAt
        FROM Note
        WHERE ownerId = user.id
        ORDER BY updatedAt DESC
        LIMIT 1
) DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

That gives us this output:

```
QUERY PLAN
|--SCAN user
|--SEARCH image USING INDEX UserImage_userId_key (userId=?) LEFT-JOIN
|--CORRELATED SCALAR SUBQUERY 1
|  |--SEARCH Note USING INDEX Note_ownerId_idx (ownerId=?)
|  `--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
`--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```

Huh... Yeah, there are a couple things going on in there. Let's build up the
query a bit at a time so we can talk about each bit.

üê® Let's start with this:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name
FROM User AS user
LIMIT 50;
```

That should give you this:

```
QUERY PLAN
`--SCAN user
```

Remember what a SCAN with no index means? It says "read every record." But it's
only happening because there's no `WHERE` or `ORDER BY` clause.

üê® Add an `ORDER BY` clause:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name
FROM User AS user
ORDER BY user.username
LIMIT 50;
```

```
QUERY PLAN
`--SCAN user USING INDEX User_username_key
```

Great, we're using an index, so that'll be much more efficient.

üê® Let's try it out with the `name` column (which is not indexed):

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name
FROM User AS user
ORDER BY user.name
LIMIT 50;
```

This gives us:

```
QUERY PLAN
|--SCAN user
`--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```

So here's something new. Because the `user.name` column is not indexed, the
database has to scan the user without an index, but in order to sort the data by
`user.name`, it has to store all the user's names in a temporary "B-TREE" data
structure so it can do the sorting for the order by. This is going to eat up
some memory for the space for the data structure, and CPU for performing the
comparison.

But that's getting side-tracked. We're not ordering by the user's name. Let's
get back on track.

üê® We'll add back the `ORDER BY user.username` for a second so we can see what
the `LEFT JOIN` does to our query:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name
FROM User AS user
LEFT JOIN UserImage AS image ON user.id = image.userId
ORDER BY user.username
LIMIT 50;
```

And that gives us:

```
QUERY PLAN
`--SCAN user USING INDEX User_username_key
```

At first this may surprise you, but the optimizer has determined that it can
skip the `LEFT JOIN` entirely because we're not referencing it anywhere else
in the query.

üê® Add `image.id` in the select

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name, image.id as imageId
FROM User AS user
LEFT JOIN UserImage AS image ON user.id = image.userId
ORDER BY user.username
LIMIT 50;
```

That will give us:

```
QUERY PLAN
|--SCAN user USING INDEX User_username_key
`--SEARCH image USING INDEX UserImage_userId_key (userId=?) LEFT-JOIN
```

Super, with that we get a "SEARCH" using an index on the foreign key, so that
should be quick enough. This is because the `ON` predicate is on the indexed
column.

üê® Alrighty, let's add the `WHERE` clause with the `LIKE` in:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name, image.id as imageId
FROM User AS user
LEFT JOIN UserImage AS image ON user.id = image.userId
WHERE user.username LIKE '%kody%'
ORDER BY user.username
LIMIT 50;
```

```
QUERY PLAN
|--SCAN user USING INDEX User_username_key
`--SEARCH image USING INDEX UserImage_userId_key (userId=?) LEFT-JOIN
```

Whoops! It is using an index for the `ORDER BY`, but it's not telling us that
it's likely not using an index for the `LIKE` (according to
[the rules](https://www.sqlite.org/optoverview.html#the_like_optimization)).

üê® Let's add the `OR` for the `user.name`:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name, image.id as imageId
FROM User AS user
LEFT JOIN UserImage AS image ON user.id = image.userId
WHERE user.username LIKE '%kody%'
OR user.name LIKE '%kody%'
ORDER BY user.username
LIMIT 50;
```

```
QUERY PLAN
|--SCAN user USING INDEX User_username_key
`--SEARCH image USING INDEX UserImage_userId_key (userId=?) LEFT-JOIN
```

It's still leverage the index for the `ORDER BY`, but it's not telling us that
it's likely not using an index for the `LIKE`.

üê® Before we put the subquery in the `ORDER BY`, let's look at the subquery on
its own:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT updatedAt
FROM Note
WHERE ownerId = "some_id"
ORDER BY updatedAt DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

```
QUERY PLAN
|--SEARCH Note USING INDEX Note_ownerId_idx (ownerId=?)
`--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```

Here we are again with the `TEMP B-TREE` for the `ORDER BY`. This is because
the `updatedAt` column is not indexed. So for _every_ note for the user, it has
to store the `updatedAt` in a temporary data structure so it can sort it to find
the one that was most recently updated. Definitely something fishy here...

üê® Now, let's put that query as a subquery in the `ORDER BY`:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name, image.id as imageId
FROM User AS user
LEFT JOIN UserImage AS image ON user.id = image.userId
WHERE user.username LIKE '%kody%'
OR user.name LIKE '%kody%'
ORDER BY (
  SELECT updatedAt
  FROM Note
  WHERE ownerId = user.id
  ORDER BY updatedAt DESC
  LIMIT 1
) DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

```
QUERY PLAN
|--SCAN user
|--SEARCH image USING INDEX UserImage_userId_key (userId=?) LEFT-JOIN
|--CORRELATED SCALAR SUBQUERY 1
|  |--SEARCH Note USING INDEX Note_ownerId_idx (ownerId=?)
|  `--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
`--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```

Now explain is (finally) showing that we're scanning because there's no index in
use on the user table (it was scanning the whole time silly). But, it's now also
showing a `TEMP B-TREE` for the order by, and because that's a subquery, that
will happen for _every user_ üò±. Very very bad.

We need to optimize the `ORDER BY` sub query, and then the whole query should
run much faster. Because that query is against the Note table, the index we need
will go on the `Note` model.

## Identify the index

Remember the photo album metaphor? In that example, the first folder you want is
the one where you're trying to filter things. That's often the column most
frequently used in your queries. While individual indexes can certainly be
beneficial for corresponding single-column queries, for multi-column queries, a
well-designed composite index is often more efficient.

<callout-info>
	Generally, in a composite (multi-column) index, start with the column that is
	most frequently used in your `WHERE` clause and can be most utilized, then add
	frequently `ORDER BY` columns to the end of the index.
</callout-info>

This often means you start with "bigger buckets" and get more specific as you
go.

<callout-success>
	While these rules are not hard and fast, they are a good starting point. You
	should always test your queries to see if they're using the indexes you expect
	them to use and if they're performing well.
</callout-success>

So in our case, we look at the `WHERE` and then the `ORDER BY` to determine our
indexes. We're referencing the `updatedAt` in the `ORDER BY` and the `ownerId` in
the `WHERE`. We need to combine these columns in a single index to optimize this
query.

üê® So, let's sort first by the `ownerId` and then by the `updatedAt`.

üê® <InlineFile file="prisma/schema.prisma">Open up the `prisma/schema.prisma` file</InlineFile>
and add an index for the `ownerId` and `updatedAt`.

üê® Now run:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db push
```

<callout-warning>
	Remember, this does not update your migration file. You'll want to do that
	when you're ready to commit to this. We're just testing things out for now.
</callout-warning>

If you'd like, you can execute this command in SQLite and it will show you all
the indexes active in the database:

```sql
.indexes
```

That should give you something like this:

```
NoteImage_noteId_idx                   sqlite_autoindex_NoteImage_1
Note_ownerId_idx                       sqlite_autoindex_Note_1
Note_ownerId_updatedAt_idx             sqlite_autoindex_UserImage_1
UserImage_userId_key                   sqlite_autoindex_User_1
User_email_key                         sqlite_autoindex__prisma_migrations_1
User_username_key
```

Our new one is the one called `Note_ownerId_updatedAt_idx`!

üê® Now, let's run the query plan again:

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT user.id, user.username, user.name, image.id as imageId
FROM User AS user
LEFT JOIN UserImage AS image ON user.id = image.userId
WHERE user.username LIKE '%kody%'
OR user.name LIKE '%kody%'
ORDER BY (
   SELECT updatedAt
   FROM Note
   WHERE ownerId = user.id
   ORDER BY updatedAt DESC
   LIMIT 1
) DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

```
QUERY PLAN
|--SCAN user
|--SEARCH image USING INDEX UserImage_userId_key (userId=?) LEFT-JOIN
|--CORRELATED SCALAR SUBQUERY 1
|  `--SEARCH Note USING COVERING INDEX Note_ownerId_updatedAt_idx (ownerId=?)
`--USE TEMP B-TREE FOR ORDER BY
```

Sweet! We've just eliminated the `TEMP B-TREE` on the Note table! And now our
Note Search is using our new index (learn more about what "covering index
means" below). This is a huge win because query doesn't have to read every note
for every user!

<callout-muted class="aside">
	Note we do still have a non-indexed scan for the user, but based on the
	requirements of a wildcard prefix in the `LIKE`, an index won't help anyway.
</callout-muted>

<details>

<summary>Incidental Covering Index</summary>

If you're curious, we just happen to have what's known as a "covering index"
here, which means SQLite doesn't even have to read _any_ records from the Note
table. It can just read the index and get the data it needs. This is because all
the columns used by the query are covered by the index and is _highly_
efficient. You can learn more about this from
[the SQLite Query Planner docs](https://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html#_covering_indexes)

</details>

üê® Now go ahead and try searching users again: <LinkToApp to="/users" />

Checking our logs, we're getting about `30ms` per query when there's no search
term, and just a couple milliseconds when there is a search term. Going from 8
seconds to 30ms is over 250x faster! Nice!
