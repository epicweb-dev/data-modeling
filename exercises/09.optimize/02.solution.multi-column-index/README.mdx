# Multi-Column Index

👨‍💼 I know that was a lot of work for a single line code change, but honestly a
lot of the time, performance work is like that.

And this made a _huge_ impact. We were thinking about adding a couple Redis
clusters and pumping up the specs of our server to deal with this slow query and
now we don't have to bother because we have a good index. You've just saved us
many many dollars. Here, have a raise. 🤑

Great work!
