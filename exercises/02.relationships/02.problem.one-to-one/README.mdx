# One-to-One Relationships

👨‍💼 We still need to deal with the Note images. And we're also going to add
images to the users as well. Before we do, Olivia the Owl would like to have a
word with you about data modeling...

🦉 One thing you want to think about when you're building out your data model
is... the future.

<callout-warning>
	**CAUTION**: The future is impossible to predict. All you really can
	reasonably predict about the future is that things will change. But you don't
	know how. That said, it can be useful to build things in such a way that
	optimizes for change provided it doesn't make things sub-optimal for the
	present.
</callout-warning>

Consider, for example, that you are building a house. You're considering what to
do about the pool you want one day. You know you don't want it now, but you may
want to add one in the future. With that in mind, you may think about where the
pool should go, and you decide to avoid planting trees there. Depending on how
confident you are that you will get the pool you may even consider placing the
plumbing for the pool in the ground before you pour the foundation so you don't
have the pay the cost of digging things up later. You just need to weigh the
costs of doing that now vs. the cost of doing it later and the likelihood you'll
actually get the pool.

For our notes to have images, we just need a place to store the bytes for the
image, it's content type, and the alt text. It's not much data. But if you think
about a note taking app, it's reasonable to assume folks will want to upload
more than just images to their notes. Maybe they'll want to upload a `csv` or a
`pdf` or any number of other types of files.

So we should think about modeling things in such a way that it makes supporting
these other file types without complicating our data model in the present or
having a difficult migration in the future.

👨‍💼 Thanks for that Olivia.

🦉 Oh, one other thing... On the subject of images... We'll be storing our
images directly in the database. Turns out, in some cases,
[serving files from SQLite can be 35% faster than the file system](https://www.sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html)
(and can be more space efficient as well)! Even in situations where that's not
the case, it's certainly not much slower. So while you definitely can bring in
another service to manage storing the images for you, or store it to a
persistent volume, starting out with the images in the database is a perfectly
reasonable approach for many applications.

👨‍💼 Ok, great. Thanks Olivia! So, with that said, instead of making a single
`Image` model, we're going to have a `File` model that holds the content type
and file bytes, and then we'll have an `Image` model that references the file
and adds the alt text.

And then our `Note` and `User` models will be connected. So we'll have the
following relationships:

- `User` -> `Image`: one-to-one
- `Note` -> `Image`: one-to-many
- `Image` -> `File`: one-to-one

<callout-danger>
	Don't forget that the Prisma VSCode extension, can automatically capitalize
	the property names it adds which is annoying. Just double check that all
	properties are lower-case.

The emoji should be in the schema file to help guide you through this.

💰 Remember, if you get stuck on the syntax, remember you can check
the <Link to="?preview=diff">Diff Tab</Link> to check your work against the
solution.

Once you've got the model in a good place, then let's push that to the database:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db push
```

And now let's check out the studio:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```

Now we want to create a new image/file. The tricky bit here is Prisma studio
represents files as base64 encoded strings which is fine, I even prepared this
base64 image for you:

```

```

Sadly, I couldn't find a way to create one-to-one required relationships in the
Prisma studio. So it's time to move to some code!

Let's create a script to do this for
us: <InlineFile file="prisma/seed.ts">Click here to create `prisma/seed.ts`</InlineFile>

Go ahead and stick this in there:

```tsx
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import fs from 'node:fs'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

const newImage1 = await prisma.image.create({
	data: {
		altText: 'an adorable koala cartoon illustration',
		file: {
			create: {
				contentType: 'image/png',
				blob: await fs.promises.readFile(
					'./tests/fixtures/images/kody-notes/cute-koala.png',
				),
			},
		},
	},
})

const newImage2 = await prisma.image.create({
	data: {
		altText: 'a cartoon illustration of a koala in a tree eating',
		file: {
			create: {
				contentType: 'image/png',
				blob: await fs.promises.readFile(
					'./tests/fixtures/images/kody-notes/koala-eating.png',
				),
			},
		},
	},
})

const firstNote = await prisma.note.findFirst()

if (!firstNote) {
	throw new Error('You need to have a note in the database first')
}

await prisma.note.update({
	where: { id: firstNote.id },
	data: {
		images: {
			connect: [{ id: newImage1.id }, { id: newImage2.id }],
		},
	},
})
```

We'll dive deeper into this later...

Next, let's run it. Because this is a TypeScript file, you'll need to use `tsx`
instead of `node`:

```sh nonumber
npx tsx ./prisma/seed.ts
```

Great, with that done, now open up the studio:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```

You should have your note with the two images and two files in there now.
Huzzah! We'll get further into the seeding capability later, but this is a good
verification that our model is working.
