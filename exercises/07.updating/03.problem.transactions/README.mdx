# Transactions

👨‍💼 Whoops! So we've got an issue. If one of the steps in our multi-step process
to update a note fails, we'll end up with a halfway updated note. This is
problematic for our situation, but it could be worse (like in the banking
example we had in the introduction to this exercise).

As a reminder, here's the example of prisma's transaction API:

```tsx
await prisma.$transaction(async $prisma => {
	await $prisma.rocket.update({
		where: { id: 1 },
		data: { name: 'Falcon 9' },
	})
	await $prisma.rocket.update({
		where: { id: 2 },
		data: { name: 'Falcon Heavy' },
	})
})
```

With that, you should be enough to get going! Let's put all of these note update
steps in a single transaction.

🧝‍♂️ If you'd like to test things out, I left a comment in there for an error.
With that error, you should be able to update a note and get deleted images,
but no new images or updated images. Your job is to make it so it all succeeds
or fails together.
