# Update

👨‍💼 We need to fix our note edit so we can save edits to our notes in the SQLite
database instead of our old in-memory database.

So here's what I want you to do, and the emoji in the file will help you:

1. Update the note
2. Delete the images that are no longer in the note
3. Update the images that are still in the note
4. Add the new images to the note

## Caching and IDs

Our images are cached with `Cache-Control` headers, so if the an image is
updated, we could end up with a stale image in the browser cache. To fix this,
we can change the ID of the image if the user updates it. So even though the
database normally creates IDs for us, we're going to need to create our own ID
in this case. We'll be using the module
[`@paralleldrive/cuid2`](https://npm.im/@paralleldrive/cuid2) to generate our
`cuid` in this case.
