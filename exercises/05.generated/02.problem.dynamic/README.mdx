# Dynamic Data

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicweb.dev/workshops/data-modeling-deep-dive/generating-seed-data/dynamically-generating-data" />

🧝‍♂️ I've fixed things up a little bit and added some organization for us. Just so
you know. I've also created a couple utility functions for creating users to
make that data a tad bit more realistic and creating images that we've already
got in our `tests/fixtures/images` directory.

Here's a quick example of how my `img` utility helps us create images:

```tsx remove=5-15 add=16-19
await prisma.user.create({
	data: {
		// stuff here
		image: {
			create: {
				altText: `someone at the end of a cry session who's starting to feel a little better.`,
				file: {
					create: {
						contentType: 'image/png',
						blob: await fs.promises.readFile(
							'./tests/fixtures/images/notes/9.png',
						),
					},
				},
			},
			create: await img({
				altText: `someone at the end of a cry session who's starting to feel a little better.`,
				filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/9.png',
			}),
		},
	},
})
```

Additionally, I've also pre-loaded all the images for you, so you can simplify
it even further if you want:

```tsx remove=4-9 add=10
await prisma.user.create({
	data: {
		// stuff here
		image: {
			create: await img({
				altText: `someone at the end of a cry session who's starting to feel a little better.`,
				filepath: './tests/fixtures/images/notes/9.png',
			}),
		}
		image: { create: noteImages[9] },
	},
})
```

I also moved things around a bit generally to be more organized and ready for
your exercise. No need to thank me. I'm just doing my job. 😎 (🦉 but you really
should thank your co-workers because it's a nice thing to do).

👨‍💼 **Thanks** Kellie! Utilities like this are pretty critical for generating
data that's specific to our application. Alright, so we're going to need you to
generate a lot more data. We'll have the emoji in there to help guide you
through this a bit. As a reminder, here's one way you could do this:

```ts
const things = await Promise.all(
	Array.from({ length: numberOfThings }, async () => {
		// create your async thing...
	}),
)
```

And you can use Faker to create random numbers of things with:

```ts
const things = await Promise.all(
	Array.from({ length: faker.number.int({ min: 0, max: 5 }) }, async () => {
		// create your async thing...
	}),
)
```

<callout-warning>
	It's very possible you will *hate* the level of expression nesting going on
	here. That is totally fine. If you'd rather go with a more imperative style of
	multiple statements and loops, that's totally fine. I personally prefer the
	nesting, but there's more than one way to do this.

<callout-info>
	SQLite doesn't support `createMany`, so that's why we have to do a single
	`create` call per record we want to insert.

🐨 Once you're happy with your seed script, let's run it!

```sh nonumber
npx prisma db seed
```

🐨 And then open up the Prisma Studio to see your generated data:

```sh nonumber
npx prisma studio
```
